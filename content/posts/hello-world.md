Welcome to my blog, where I will write about Rust, Blockchain development,
probably some other nerdy stuff, and just things that spark my interest.

I am Till, and I recently made a career out of my long-held programming hobby.
Since I find blockchains and everything Web3 to be fascinating technology that
aligns a lot with how I feel things should be designed (decentralization,
Peer-to-peer), I decided to make my entry just there and also to start blogging
about what I learn. Happy I found something with Rust, as it's definitely the
most joyful high-performance language to work with.

For now I will kick this off with a "Building on NEAR" series, creating smart
contracts, testing them, deploying, redeploying, and whatever important aspects
I will pick up while learning this myself.
