This series is for you. I will do my best to explain blockchain concepts and advanced Rust whenever I can, and whenever I feel that it&amp;rsquo;s necessary. Following topics will be covered:
Interacting with the NEAR network, for which you will need an account and should have a look at the NEAR CLI tool (this post) Building smart contracts, testing them, and deploying them to a testing network Integration testing, storage migration, redeployments Gas costs and profiling, cross-contract calling, simulation testing, mainnet Indexing, testing the indexer, storage migrations and indexing Smart contracts standards for the NEAR ecosystem Let&amp;rsquo;s kickstart this series by getting you a NEAR account.</description></item></channel></rss>
